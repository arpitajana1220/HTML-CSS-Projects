# YouTube Clone Project

## Overview
This project is a YouTube Clone created using HTML and CSS. It's a part of my learning journey where I've completed over 60 assignments while following the course from [YouTube Clone Tutorial](https://youtu.be/G3e-cpL7ofc?si=u6mZRGO_uYpJo8Y4).

The goal of this project was to gain practical experience in web development and frontend design, replicating the core features and design of YouTube. By following the tutorial and working on assignments, I've learned and applied HTML and CSS concepts, layout design, and styling elements to mimic the YouTube interface.

## Project Features
- **HTML & CSS**: The project primarily focuses on HTML and CSS to recreate the structure and style of the YouTube website.
